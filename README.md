# SCPStats
SCPStats is a stat tracking plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows players to track their stats across multiple servers, as well as providing server hosts with detailed server analytics.

## Getting Started
Currently, SCPStats is WIP but is able to record player and server stats. This beta version can be installed to provide your players with stats when SCPStats fully releases. To use SCPStats, you first need to register your server with the website.

## Registering your Server
The SCPStats website is very WIP and does not have much effort put into actual the design of the site. SCPStat's full release will include a redesigned website.

To register your server, first login to SCPStats through https://scpstats.com/login . Then, register your server through https://scpstats.com/account/servers/add/ (you can register as many servers as you want). Once your server is registered, you will be redirected to a page where you can view all of your registered servers, along with their Server ID and Secret. You will need the Server ID and Secret to configure the SCPStats plugin.

## Configuration
Once you have your Server ID and Secret, registration is simple. Simply put your Server ID and Secret under the relevent configuration options in your server's config. That's it. SCPStats will begin recording stats.

## Request Data Removal
Because of the limited functionality of the site, it isn't currently possible to remove data yourself. If you want to remove any data from the site, simply contact me at contact@scpstats.com and your data will be removed.
